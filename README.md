# Poolside Vim Theme

Generated by [Themer](https://github.com/mjswensen/themer)
Palette inspired by [poolside.fm](https://poolside.fm)

## Configuration

```vim
colorscheme poolside
syntax enable
```

### Italics Support
This theme supports italics for code comments;  since not all terminals support italics this is something you'll have to enable in your vim configuration if you want to use it with your italics friendly terminal:

```vim
" Enable italicized coments
let g:poolside_terminal_italics=1
```
